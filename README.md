### Steps:-
#### Data Processing & Cleaning
Before publishing the dataset, the following preprocessing steps were applied to ensure consistency, accuracy, and usability:

##### ‚úÖ 1. Null Value Handling
Removed records with critical missing values such as:

incident_id

date

state or city

crime_type

For less critical fields (e.g., weapon_used, suspect_gender), missing values were:

Filled with 'Unknown' or 'Not Reported', depending on the context.

###### üìè 2. Outlier Detection & Removal
Applied statistical methods (e.g., IQR, Z-score) to detect and remove:

Implausible coordinates (e.g., outside US lat/lon bounds).

Invalid dates (e.g., future dates after March 2025).

Unrealistic values for numeric fields like weapon counts or arrests.

##### üïí 3. Date & Time Normalization
Standardized all date fields to ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.

Parsed and corrected malformed or inconsistent date entries.

Extracted additional temporal features:

year, month, day, weekday, and hour for time-based analysis.

## To demonstrate the value of this dataset, an interactive Power BI dashboard was created. The dashboard provides a visual exploration of crime trends across the United States from 2020 to March 2025.
